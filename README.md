## What is this?
A basic laravel setup with already composer install running. So you dont have to install any composer or sail (docker) to run laravel.

## Problem Statement
There is many time I need to create a Laravel project but there is no composer install on the machine. This happen many times, especially during new docker installation and it's feel like a sin to install composer on docker just to run it once and then never touch it again.

## Installation

**Prerequisite**

-   PHP >=7.4

To setup Laravel No Composer, first clone the project and change the directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alifdarsim/laravel-no-composer.git my-project
cd my-project
```

Then follow the process using either and you will have a fully running basic Laravel installation.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

    ```shell
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

1. Generate application key:

    ```shell
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

2. Start the server (local):

    ```shell
    php artisan serve
    ```

Voilaaa! You just install laravel without using composer or laravel sail. After this, you can continue the normal laravel setup installation such as 'php artisan migrate'
