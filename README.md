## What is this?
A basic laravel setup with already composer install running. So you dont have to install any composer or sail (docker) to run laravel.

## Problem Statement
There is many time I need to create a Laravel project but there is no composer install on the machine or I just cant install composer due to sudo issue. 

This happen many times, especially during new docker installation and it's feel like a sin to install composer on docker just to run it once and then never touch it again.

## Installation

**Prerequisite**

| Version | PHP(*)  |
|---------|---------|
| Laravel 8 | 7.3-8.1 |
| Laravel 9 | 8.0-8.1 |
| Laravel 10 | 8.1     |

* To install, use <b>CURL</b> method as below
```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alifdarsim/laravel-no-composer/master/curl.sh)
```

* Or if you dont have curl installed, use <b>wget</b> instead
```sh
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alifdarsim/laravel-no-composer/master/curl.sh)
```

After the installation finish, run below command to run laravel

1. Generate application key:

    ```shell
    cd your-project-name
    ```

2. Start the server (local):

    ```shell
    php artisan serve
    ```

Voilaaa! You just install laravel without using composer or laravel sail. After this, you can continue the normal laravel setup installation such as 'php artisan migrate'
