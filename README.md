## Problem Statement
There is many time I need to create a Laravel project but there is no composer install on the machine or I just cant install composer due to sudo issue. 

This happen many times, especially during new docker installation and it's feel like a sin to install composer on a docker just to run it once and then never touch it again.

## What is this?
A bash script to install laravel with vendor folder pre-installed. So you dont have to install any composer or sail (docker) to run laravel.


## Prerequisite

| Version | PHP(*)  |
|---------|---------|
| Laravel 8 | 7.3-8.1 |
| Laravel 9 | 8.0-8.1 |
| Laravel 10 | 8.1     |

## Installation

To start installing Laravel, run below *curl* or *wget* command
   
- If you prefer to use CURL
```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alifdarsim/laravel-no-composer/master/curl.sh)
```

- Or you want wget instead
```sh
bash <(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alifdarsim/laravel-no-composer/master/wget.sh)
```

You will be promped to name your Laravel project and choose Laravel version to install
```sh
Enter your Laravel project name (eg: my-project)
 > my-project
Choose Laravel version to install:
   Laravel 8.x
 > Laravel 9.x
   Laravel 10.x
```


After the installation finish, run below command to run your laravel project
   
```sh
cd my-project
php artisan serve
```

Voilaaa! You just success installing laravel without using composer or laravel sail. After this, you can continue the normal laravel setup installation such as **php artisan migrate**

## Troubleshooting

**Q**: I got an error when using this package.

**A**: Most error happen due to missing PHP dependencies required by Laravel itself. Simply make sure you install all of the PHP extension needed depends on your PHP version as shown <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/40816033/13228282">here</a>
